# 💐 WooCommerce dimensions calculator

This plugin adds a *dimensions* calculator underneath the *quantity* input. 
It allows a customer to calculate the amount of products it needs for the 
given dimensions.

### 👜 Support

Currently only [SI-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) units are supported.
If you want support for other units, like feet or mile etc., create an issue.

### 🔌 Installation

Download the code as a ZIP

Place the contents of the ZIP into the plugins folder.

Don't rename the folder name inside the ZIP file, this to prevent errors when an
update is available.

### 💾 Configuration

You can show the form by enabling the *Show dimensions form* 
from the `General` options tab in a WooCommerce product.
